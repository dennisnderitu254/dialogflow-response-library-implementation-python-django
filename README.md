# Implementing Dialogflow Python Response Library in Python and Django

This repository is to demonstrate the implementation of our [Dialogflow response library](https://github.com/pragnakalp/dialogflow-webhook-response-libary-in-python) in Python and Django to create various types of responses for Google Assistant (Actions on Google), Telegram and Facebook chatbot.

First of all, you will need to follow our blog - [Dialogflow Tutorial: Create Fulfillment Webhook Using Python + Django](https://www.pragnakalp.com/dialogflow-tutorial-create-fulfillment-webhook-using-python-django/) - to create a basic webhook in Python + Django. Once you are done with that, you can update the code of views.py file from this repository.

**Views.py file has sample responses of:**
- Suggestion Chips
- Basic Card
- Link Out Suggestion
- List
- Carousel Card
- Browse Carousel Card
